description: Template for generating a Jekyll website based on the Moonwalk (@abhinavs/moonwalk) theme

I personally use the [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) Jekyll theme by [abhinavs](https://github.com/abhinavs) a lot, so this is a GitHub template that you can use to quickly create a Moonwalk website.

# Getting Started
- Click the `Use this template` button on the top of [this](https://github.com/Zo-Bro-23/moonwalk-template) repo
- Wait a couple of minutes for the GitHub Actions workflow to finish running
- Go to `Settings` and enable GitHub Pages to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch
- Your site should be up and running!
- For local development, fork this repo
- Make sure Jekyll and Ruby is up-to-date
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Your site should be locally live
